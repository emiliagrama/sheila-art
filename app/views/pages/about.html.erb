    <p class="card__title">SOFT PATTERNS  cylinders and panels 1973 – 1978
</p>
    <p class="card__description">
      My first Installation series, Soft Patterns panels and
      cylinders, I began in Milan, Italy in 1973. As a reaction to
      finding so many American consumer products the patterns were
      my reaction to world uniformity. Long term patterns
      constitute the future of any society.  I used the objects
      as signs and their repetition as patterns. Over the years
      they became more like symbols and a language to help read
      the future. The series was exhibited in many museums
      including Palazzo Arengario in Milan, the Utah Museum
      of Fine Art, Nexus Foundation for today's Art in
      Philadelphia, Fyns Kunstmuseum in Denmark, Gulbenkian
      Museum of Modern Art in Lisbon and many others in
      quite a few different countries.

    <p class="card__title"> HIEROGLYPHICS 1982 – 1992

</p>
    <p class="card__description">
Using simple imprints of everyday objects, stripped away everything unnecessary and reduced the image to pure form. It was the combination of signs that made them look like you could read them, as if they might be some forgotten ancient language. When hung together, they seemed to acquire a meaning of their own.
Diane Waldman, Deputy Director, Solomon Guggenheim Museum, New York City 1987
“The Guggenheim is happy to have acquired your work Hieroglyphics and is proud to have it as part of it's collection...”
Alexandra Tuttle
“...Reid's work hints at the underlying unity in the universe. Some of her symbols resemble sacred languages... Yet in a curious alchemy that only art can achieve, Reid manages to transform the banal signs of our civilization's mediocrity into a powerful secret universe.”

</p>
    <p class="card__description">
Libery was a structure made at the request of a group of artists doing a show of monumental works that traveled around France. It was called Liberty partly because of the bright colors and partly because it was celebrating freedom from old ideas and customs.

    <p class="card__title"> PLENITUDE  scrolls 2016 - 2023

</p>
    <p class="card__description">
Scrolls were an ancient form of art. Mine are different though. In 2016 my husband was very ill and my time was spent caring for him. Maybe for comfort, I began cutting all my previous 20 years of drawings into pieces, probably because cutting them felt strangely therapeutic.
     Then I glued random pieces onto photographic paper in different configurations. When
finished, I had four hundred collages, and I began stitching some of them on to scrolls.
Each scroll has six collages and each is a slightly different size, about  25 cm x 190 cm.
     Probably the most curious thing about Plenitude is that they're made from years of
drawings which were almost all done when I was grieving for someone dear who
had died. Their joyful appearance is rather strange because the drawings originated in such pain.

    <p class="card__title">FEMININE REFLECTIONS 1985

</p>
    <p class="card__description">
“FEMININE REFLECTIONS 1985 is about attitudes rather than visual symbols, it asks about stereotyped attitudes towards women, ambiguity, jealousy and weakness.   The piece comes alive by who it reflects, more than an image from it's own being.”

France Delville, Art Critic, (L'Atelier du Futur Revue des Universities du XXI Siecle magazine 1996 2014 translation)
“The elements in her work become beautiful in the repetition, in the structured accumulation. I'm thinking
of her Feminine Reflections... that sends shock waves through you, not because of the individual elements
but because of the whole.”
